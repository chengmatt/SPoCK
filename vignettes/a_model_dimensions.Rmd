The following tables describes all elements contained within `input_list$data`, which is generated using the `SPoRC::Setup_x` functions. Note that they do not detail how the `SPoRC::Setup_x` functions should be utilized, rather, they detail the components of `input_list$data`. Thus, for further details on how arguments for `SPoRC::Setup_x` functions should be defined, users should refer to the function documentation. Furthermore, note that when `n_sexes > 1`, the first dimension will always be females and the second dimension will always be males.

This is then coupled with move_age_tag_pool and move_sex_tag_pool (see last two rows in this table for an example) to ensure that the predicted recaptures are summed across ages and sexes when fitting to the observed recaptures for a given likelihood.
